Linked Lists

- collection of data elements, called nodes
- contain reference to the next node in the list
- hold whatever data the application needs
- elements can be easily inserted and removed
- underlying memory doesnâ€™t need to be reorganized
- cant do constant-time random item access
- item lookup is linear in time complexity (O(n))
